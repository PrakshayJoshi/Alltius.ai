Here ‘realization of funds’ means that NAV applicable for your order will depend on if the fund house has receievd money or not Please find the cut-off timings for various types of funds and orders Furthermore, NAV applicability for orders placed on Saturday, Sundays and other market/public holidays depends on when orders are placed on exchange. Here it is the next business day. Payments made via UPI mode generally result in same-day NAV if the order is placed before cut-off. This happens because settlement to ICCL happens generally happens before cut-off if made via UPI. Angel One depends on payment aggregator for ICCL settlements. Payments made via Netbanking generally result in next working day’s NAV. This happens as settlement to ICCL does not happen real time and generally takes places on ‘T+1’ basis. Angel One depends on payment aggregator for ICCL settlements. So even if order and payment is successful before cut-off, If the payment mode is netbanking, This might result in next day’s NAV. In Summary, In some cases, Even if order and payment happens before cut-off, NAV will depend on settlement to ICCL and realization of funds by AMC"

With an already pending stop-loss or exit order, you will need extra funds to be able to place a duplicate SL/exit order.

That’s why we inform you while exiting if there’s a Pending SL/exit order against a position, to avoid any duplicate orders and rejections."

    "text": "Q: My Stop-Loss (SL) order was triggered but it did not get executed. Why did this happen?\nA: There could be 2 major reasons behind this: The asset may be lacking a buyer/seller at the defined stop-loss limit price due to a lack of market depth. Orders are queued while they are being purchased or sold. a. For example: Let’s say there are 50 buyers and 100 sellers who are waiting to trade on a scrip at ₹90. Upon reaching ₹90, the first 50 sellers’ orders will be executed, and the remaining 50 sellers will have to wait for new buyers. In case you are one of those remaining 50 sellers, your sell order will remain pending if there are no corresponding buyers and vice versa. The price movement during high volatility does not fulfill certain criteria e.g. suppose you have placed a sell stop-loss with trigger Price at ₹100 and limit price at ₹100. Now imagine that the LTP touched ₹100 (here, the SL would be triggered) and quickly went below ₹100 due to high volatility. The limit price of ₹100 means the stop-loss order would get executed at only ₹100 or more. Now this order will be pending as price is below Rs 100 and execution will happen only when price has reached or crossed Rs 100. Hence your stop-loss order was not executed. Due to this reason, we recommend keeping a sufficient gap between the trigger price and limit price to increase the chances of Stop Loss execution during high volatility. Note: In order to increase the chances of execution, we keep the default value of the limit price 2 ticks away from the trigger price. This is done so that if the LTP moves rapidly after triggering the order, the limit price shouldn’t be a hindrance and the order should still get executed. Also, if you change the pre-set limit price and bring it closer to the Trigger Price, the chances of execution can reduce in cases of volatility."

    "text": "Q: My stop-loss order got triggered even though the predefined Trigger Price had not appeared. Why?\nA: Chances are that the market price did hit the stop-loss price, albeit momentarily and without you being able to spot it at that moment. Within a second, prices can change multiple times and not all of them are relayed to the Brokers by Exchange, especially during high volatility. As a result, such momentary price fluctuations are not seen anywhere. Price matching and execution of the orders  is done by the Exchanges and not the Broker."

If the security price rises or falls against you, the trigger price stays in place depending on the nature of the order."

Here ‘realization of funds’ means that NAV applicable for your order will depend on if the fund house has receievd money or not Please find the cut-off timings for various types of funds and orders Furthermore, NAV applicability for orders placed on Saturday, Sundays and other market/public holidays depends on when orders are placed on exchange. Here it is the next business day. Payments made via UPI mode generally result in same-day NAV if the order is placed before cut-off. This happens because settlement to ICCL happens generally happens before cut-off if made via UPI. Angel One depends on payment aggregator for ICCL settlements. Payments made via Netbanking generally result in next working day’s NAV. This happens as settlement to ICCL does not happen real time and generally takes places on ‘T+1’ basis. Angel One depends on payment aggregator for ICCL settlements. So even if order and payment is successful before cut-off, If the payment mode is netbanking, This might result in next day’s NAV. In Summary, In some cases, Even if order and payment happens before cut-off, NAV will depend on settlement to ICCL and realization of funds by AMC"

    "text": "Q: Why doesn't my Limit order get executed after I reach the price I want?\nA: It does not guarantee that your order will be executed even if your price has been reached. Orders are queued while being bought or sold. For Example. Assume you placed a Buy limit order of 100 Rs for the ABC script. Let’s say there are 100 buyers and 50 sellers waiting to trade in ABC at 100. ABC is currently trading at 105 Rs and after a few minutes, it reaches 100 Rs. Since there are only 50 sellers for 100 Rs, only 50 buyers will be able to buy the script once this price is reached. As for the other 50 buyers, they’ll have to wait until more sellers become available."
