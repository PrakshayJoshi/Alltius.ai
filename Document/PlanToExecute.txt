Next Steps
Text cleaning

Use regex to strip out page headers/footers and line-break artifacts.

Normalize whitespace (e.g. collapse multiple spaces/newlines).

Chunking

Slide a window of ~250 words (with some overlap, say 50 words) to create “passages.”

Store each passage with metadata: { pdf_filename, chunk_index, text }.

Embedding & Vector Store

Turn each cleaned chunk into an embedding vector.

Index in FAISS (or your vector database of choice).

RAG Pipeline

At query time: embed question → retrieve top-k chunks → feed those along with the question into the LLM → return the answer (or “I don’t know” if no good match).
